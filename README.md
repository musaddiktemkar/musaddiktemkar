Hi there! I'm Musaddik—a curious and driven developer taking my first steps into the world of programming.  
Currently, I'm immersing myself in **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**, finding joy in solving problems and crafting creative, scalable solutions.  
It's an exciting journey, and I'm constantly learning something new along the way!

## My Repositories

### 1. [async-lru-cache](https://github.com/musaddiktemkar/async-lru-cache)
This is the repository for my npm package, [@musaddikt/async-lru-cache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@musaddikt/async-lru-cache).  
It provides an asynchronous **Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache**, ideal for memory-efficient applications.  

Key Features:
- Fully asynchronous
- Lightweight and fast
- Easily integrable with Node.js applications
- **Supports both CommonJS and ESM**, ensuring compatibility across different module systems  

Feel free to check it out and provide your feedback!

### 2. [showdown](https://github.com/musaddiktemkar/showdown)
This project is a step towards hosting my **private Pokémon Showdown server**.  
I'm working on optimizing and customizing the server to provide a seamless experience for users.  

Stay tuned for more updates and features as I bring this project to life!
